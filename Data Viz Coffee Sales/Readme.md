# SEMI-ANNUAL SALES DYNAMIC DASHBOARD (TABLEAU)
## Coffee sales

I created this dynamic Coffee sales dashboard showing sales from the first week of January 2024 to the last week of June 2024.

1. Created Sales KPI.
2. Created a line chart showing the trend for Sales by Week.
3. Created a sales-by-employee bar chart to see top employee performers.
4. Created a sales-by-coffee bar chart to see which coffee has the most sales.
5. Created filters to filter specific data in the line charts and the bar charts when clicked
